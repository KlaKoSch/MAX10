# Intel MAX10 FPGA
The Intel MAX10 is one of very few FPGA chips with integrated Flash and ADC.  
So it is a real single chip solution for many application.

A very low cost FPGA Board with MAX10 is the MAX1000.  
It has Arduino Nano format, additional SDRAM and serial flash (each 8MByte).  
With 2 buttons (one reset), 8 LEDs and PMOD connector you can realize your project.

On of my first project on MAX1000 was the realization of a FORTH processor K1.  
The FPGA part also available here - the FORTH stuff is on http://www.mcforth.net
